# Bike-Finder
Bike-Finder helps reconnect lost bikes with their owners by providing persistent storage of information, including images, for both lost and found bikes. I'm currently working on pushing notifications to users with lost bikes when a bike is found matching their description. I used Firebase database, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and the Google Maps Javascript API.
